// ðŸš€ Node.js 20.x.x (Major Release with New Features and Enhancements)

// 1) **Experimental Permission Model**
//    * Node.js 20 introduces an experimental Permission Model, allowing developers to restrict access to specific resources during program execution, enhancing security and control over application behavior.

// Example: Implementing Permission Model
// To restrict access to the file system, you can run your Node.js application with the following flags:
// node --experimental-permission --allow-fs-read --allow-fs-write app.js

// 2) **Stable Test Runner**
//    * The test runner module has been stabilized, providing a built-in framework for writing and executing tests, streamlining the testing process without the need for external libraries.

// Example: Using the Test Runner
import { test } from 'node:test';

test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', (t) => {
    t.equal(1 + 2, 3);
});

// 3) **Synchronous `import.meta.resolve`**
//    * Node.js 20 introduces synchronous resolution of module specifiers using `import.meta.resolve`, improving module loading efficiency and consistency.

// Example: Using `import.meta.resolve`
const resolvedPath = import.meta.resolve('./module.js');
console.log(resolvedPath);  // Outputs the resolved path of 'module.js'

// 4) **V8 Engine Updated to 11.3**
//    * The V8 JavaScript engine has been updated to version 11.3, bringing performance improvements and new language features, including better support for modern JavaScript syntax and APIs.

// Example: Utilizing New V8 Features
// With V8 11.3, you can use the 'isWellFormed' method to check if a string is well-formed:
const str = 'Hello, World!';
console.log(str.isWellFormed());  // Outputs: true

// 5) **Official Support for ARM64 Windows**
//    * Node.js 20 now officially supports ARM64 Windows, allowing for native execution on ARM64 Windows platforms, expanding compatibility and performance on these devices.

// Example: Running Node.js on ARM64 Windows
// Developers can now run Node.js applications natively on ARM64 Windows devices without the need for emulation or compatibility layers.

// 6) **Progress on WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)**
//    * The WASI implementation in Node.js has been improved, simplifying the integration of WebAssembly modules into Node.js applications, enabling more efficient and portable code execution.

// Example: Using WASI in Node.js
// To run a WebAssembly module with WASI support:
// node --experimental-wasi-wasm app.wasm

// 7) **Improved Diagnostics**
//    * Node.js 20 includes enhancements to diagnostics, such as better error handling, improved trace events, and enhanced debugging capabilities, aiding developers in identifying and resolving issues more effectively.

// Example: Enhanced Error Handling
// With improved diagnostics, you can now get more detailed stack traces and error information, making debugging easier:
// try {
//   // Code that may throw an error
// } catch (error) {
//   console.error(error.stack);  // Outputs detailed stack trace
// }

// 8) **Performance Enhancements**
//    * Various performance improvements have been made, including faster file handling and web request processing, resulting in more efficient and responsive applications.

// Example: Improved File Handling
// Node.js 20 offers faster file system operations, reducing latency in I/O-bound applications:
// fs.readFileSync('largeFile.txt');

// 9) **Long-Term Support (LTS)**
//    * Node.js 20 is designated as the "Current" release and will enter Long-Term Support (LTS) in October 2023, ensuring stability and security updates for an extended period.

// Example: Upgrading to LTS
// To upgrade to the LTS version:
// nvm install --lts

// 10) **Single Executable Applications**
//    * Node.js 20 introduces the ability to create single executable applications, simplifying deployment and distribution by bundling your application and its dependencies into a single file.

// Example: Creating a Single Executable
// Use the 'pkg' package to bundle your application:
// pkg app.js

// Conclusion: Node.js 20 brings significant enhancements, including the experimental Permission Model, stable test runner, V8 engine update, and improved diagnostics, aiming to provide a more secure, efficient, and developer-friendly environment for building modern applications.
